# ChitChat
Group organization App (multi-conversation chats, polling, RSVP, expense sharing)

Traditional chat applications are not designed for handling multiple group conversations. 
These conversations get mangled into a single flow making a good conversation impossible. 
As well, traditional chat applications are not designed for the "Oh Sh.." moment, when you see that the message you sent is full of mistakes.

ChitChat overcome these two problems by allowing multiple conversation threads, and allowing to check (spelling and grammar) and edit a message while nobody has read it.

Now that we have the basic for an organized group conversation system, it was simple to add special conversation types such as:
1. Which of these options are preferrable? (Polling)
2. Who is coming tonight? (RSVP)
3. Let's share expenses on the next trip (Shared expenses).
4. Where are you guys? (Location sharing)
